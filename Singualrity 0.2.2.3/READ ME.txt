This is a mod. It's alright I guess...

It adds two Jokers. "Stellar Collapse", which eventually turns into "Singularity". "Singularity is sorta OP, but also not really. I don't know what I'm doing, I started coding a day ago and now have made this mod.


TO DO:

- Sound design probably needs to be redone (quality) ----- DONE (?)
- Singularity should probably destroy all cards played when upgrading (extra balencing + theme)
- Card redesign (Borders + Joker name on Jokers)
